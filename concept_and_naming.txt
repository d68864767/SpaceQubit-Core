# Product Conceptualization and Naming

## Unique Selling Points (USPs)

Our quantum computing product is specifically designed for space applications. The following are its distinctive features:

1. **Radiation Resistance**: The product is built with radiation-hardened materials and components to withstand the harsh space environment. It is designed to operate efficiently even under high-radiation conditions.

2. **Energy Efficiency**: Given the limited power resources in space missions, our product is designed to consume minimal power. It uses advanced quantum algorithms that require fewer computations, thereby reducing energy consumption.

3. **Compact Design**: Space is a premium in any spacecraft. Our product is designed to be compact without compromising on its capabilities. It uses miniaturized quantum computing components that deliver high performance in a small package.

## Naming the Product

After careful consideration, we have decided to name our product **QuantumOrbit Module**. The name reflects the product's application in space (Orbit) and its core technology (Quantum). The term 'Module' signifies that it can be integrated into larger systems or used standalone, providing flexibility for various space missions.
